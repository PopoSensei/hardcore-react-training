# Pekkis' Hardcore React Training

## Introduction

Welcome to my two day React Workshop. It is very important
that you read and follow these instructions **before** the actual two training
days.

## Human Requirements

- You are a developer, devsigner or such.
- You have working professional knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
  You don't have to be a guru, but the course really is not meant for
  beginners.

## Computer Requirements

- MacOS, Linux or Windows all work.
  - In Windows, it works at least in WSL 2. I use that myself when hobby coding.
    Native Windows? I have absolutely no clue.
  - If it doesn't work, just boot this up in some Linux virtual machine.
- The current stable version of Node.js (16.x) and a "normal" default version of `NPM` that probably comes bundled with the Node version. This Might work on older
  or newer ones too, but no guarantees!
- An editor / IDE that supports all the good stuff. I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) myself, and because of the LiveShare code sharing env, you probably should too.

## Installation

Start by forking / cloning this repository.

`main` is the default branch that contains the starting point for
our course.

There are other branches too. These contain the code I've done
in most of the previous courses I've teached. Interesting stuff, at least if you're
hungry for nostalgia and how the scene has changed!

### Browser extensions

You should install these Chrome extensions, or similar ones for your browser of choice.

- [React dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)

### VSCode extensions

If you use VSCode, you should install at least the following extensions.

- ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Prettier - Code formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- EditorConfig for VS Code (editorconfig.editorconfig)
- Live Share Extension Pack (ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)
- vscode-styled-components (styled-components.vscode-styled-components)
- stylelint (stylelint.vscode-stylelint)

I also seem to have these potentially relevant ones, so if you want feature
parity do install them too.

- Visual Studio IntelliCode (visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode)
- GitLens â€” Git supercharged (eamodio.gitlens)

Some extensions you might already have could conflict with these, so please
try to check that everything is a-ok. Also if you have good extensions that
I should use in addition / replacing one of these, please holler!

## Howto

### Develop

- `npm install`
- `cp .env.example .env`
- `npm run start`

Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (if that is reserved for some reason, you might get another port but the terminal should tell you that). You should see a "beautiful" welcoming
screen that contains a duckling and suggests that some people like suckling on ducklings.

There should be some helpful instructions / assertions on the screen. Please look at it carefully. If you're happy with what you see, you're done.

### Build

- `npm run build`

Look at the `dist/`

## Licensing
